///
/// ### `PointerDownEvent`
///
/// When a `PointerDownEvent` is received by the `GestureBinding` (from
/// `PlatformDispatcher.onPointerDataPacket`, as interpreted by the
/// `PointerEventConverter`), a `hitTestInView` is performed to determine which
/// `HitTestTarget` nodes are affected. (Other bindings are expected to
/// implement `hitTestInView` to defer to `HitTestable` objects. For example, the
/// rendering layer defers to the `RenderView` and the rest of the render object
/// hierarchy.)
///
/// The affected nodes then are given the event to handle (`dispatchEvent` calls
/// `HitTestTarget.handleEvent` for each affected node). If any have relevant
/// `GestureRecognizer`s, they provide the event to them using
/// `GestureRecognizer.addPointer`. This typically causes the recognizer to
/// register with the `PointerRouter` to receive notifications regarding the
/// pointer in question.
///
/// Once the hit test and dispatching logic is complete, the event is then
/// passed to the aforementioned `PointerRouter`, which passes it to any objects
/// that have registered interest in that event.
///
/// Finally, the `gestureArena` is closed for the given pointer
/// (`GestureArenaManager.close`), which begins the process of selecting a
/// gesture to win that pointer.
///
/// ### Other events
///
/// A pointer that is `PointerEvent.down` may send further events, such as
/// `PointerMoveEvent`, `PointerUpEvent`, or `PointerCancelEvent`. These are
/// sent to the same `HitTestTarget` nodes as were found when the
/// `PointerDownEvent` was received (even if they have since been disposed; it is
/// the responsibility of those objects to be aware of that possibility).
///
/// Then, the events are routed to any still-registered entrants in the
/// `PointerRouter`'s table for that pointer.
///
/// When a `PointerUpEvent` is received, the `GestureArenaManager.sweep` method
/// is invoked to force the gesture arena logic to terminate if necessary.
///
/// **Dart Source:** `binding.dart:276-607`
///
